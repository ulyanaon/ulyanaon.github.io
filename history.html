	<p> Lviv is an administrative center in western Ukraine with more than a millennium of history as a settlement, and over seven centuries as a city.
	The city was founded in 1256 by King Danylo. He named it in honor of his son, Lev. The first mention of Lviv in writing documents was in 1256.</p>
	
	<p>It became capital of the Galicia-Volyn district in 1272. Since then, it knew a great development thanks to its good location, between the Baltic and 
	the Black sea and as situated close to the Carpathian mountains. As the city has a strategic geographic location, it early had to face invaders as Tatars, 
	Turks, Moldavians and mainly Poles.

	<p>Galicia was taken over by Poland in the 14th century. Its nobility eventually adopted the Polish language and religion - Roman Catholicism but the vast 
	majority of people remained Ukrainian Orthodox and later joined the Greek Catholic Church which acknowledged the Pope's spiritual supremacy but adhered to 
	the area's Orthodox forms of worship. From 1356 the burghers had the right of self-government, which implied that all city issues were to be solved by a 
	city council, elected by wealthy citizens. In 1784, the first university was opened. Lectures were held in Latin, German, Polish and Ukrainian.</p>
